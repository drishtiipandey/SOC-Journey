# 🔐 SOC Journey

Hi! I'm an aspiring SOC analyst, documenting my path into cybersecurity — one lab, one concept, and one mistake at a time.

This repository is my **learning log + portfolio**. I’m focusing on:

- 👀 log analysis & SIEM  
- 🚨 incident investigation  
- 🎣 phishing analysis  
- 🛡️ defensive security (blue team mindset)  
- 🧠 foundations for SOC careers  

I’m learning consistently and sharing the process so others can follow along too.
